## Predicting Life Expectancy Using Machine Learning : A Comparative Approach Between Developed And Developing Countries

---

# OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to develop a predictive model using Machine Learning that accurately
estimates the life expectancy of country based on its socio-economic and health indicators, exploring
and comparing different factors affecting life expectancy in developed and developing countries.

  - Building a reliable model for life expectancy prediction.
  - Analysing factor importance in developed vs developing countries.
  - Implementing multiple ML models and compare their performance using evaluation
  metrics.
  - The model’s performance and interpretability will be optimized through feature
  selection, scaling, encoding, and hyperparameter tuning.
  - Evaluating model accuracy using evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, and R 2 ).

  (Developed/Developing), Income Composition.
  - Health-related Indicators: Adult Mortality, Infant Deaths, BMI, Measles, HIV/AIDS, Polio,
  Diphtheria
  - Spending and Infrastructure: Alcohol Consumption, Health Expenditure, hepatitis B coverage.
