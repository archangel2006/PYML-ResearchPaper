## Predicting Life Expectancy Using Machine Learning : A Comparative Approach Between Developed And Developing Countries

---

# OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to develop a predictive model using Machine Learning that accurately
estimates the life expectancy of country based on its socio-economic and health indicators, exploring
and comparing different factors affecting life expectancy in developed and developing countries.

o Building a reliable model for life expectancy prediction.
o Analysing factor importance in developed vs developing countries.
o Implementing multiple ML models and compare their performance using evaluation
metrics.
o The model’s performance and interpretability will be optimized through feature
selection, scaling, encoding, and hyperparameter tuning.
o Evaluating model accuracy using evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, and R 2 ).

# DATASET
The Dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle – [Life Expectancy Data (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
o Demographic and Economic Features : GDP, Population, Schooling, Status
(Developed/Developing), Income Composition.
o Health-related Indicators: Adult Mortality, Infant Deaths, BMI, Measles, HIV/AIDS, Polio,
Diphtheria
o Spending and Infrastructure: Alcohol Consumption, Health Expenditure, hepatitis B coverage.
